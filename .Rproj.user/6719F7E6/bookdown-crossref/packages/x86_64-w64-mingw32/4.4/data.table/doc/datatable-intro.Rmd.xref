h4:get-all-the-flights-with-jfk-as-the-origin-airport-in-the-month-of-june. – Get all the flights with  as the origin airport in the month of June.
h4:subset-rows-integer – Get the first two rows from .
h4:sort-flights-first-by-column-origin-in-ascending-order-and-then-by-dest-in-descending-order – Sort  first by column  in  order, and then by  in  order:
h4:order-is-internally-optimised  is internally optimised
h3:select-j-1d d) Select column(s) in 
h4:select-arr_delay-column-but-return-it-as-a-vector. – Select  column, but return it as a .

h4:whats-happening-here What’s happening here?
h3:f-subset-in-i-and-do-in-j f) Subset in   do in

h4:how-many-trips-have-been-made-in-2014-from-jfk-airport-in-the-month-of-june – How many trips have been made in 2014 from  airport in the month of June?
h4:special-N Special symbol :
h3:refer_j g) Great! But how can I refer to columns by names in  (like in a )?
h4:select-both-arr_delay-and-dep_delay-columns-the-data.frame-way. – Select both  and  columns the  way.
